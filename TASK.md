# Coding Challenge Questionnaire

Create a small questionnaire Web Application similar to what Typeform.com offers https://www.typeform.com/#home-examples

## Concepts

### Questionnaire
- [x] A Questionnaire has a title and a description
- [x] A questionnaire has a defined sequence of question that need to be answered

### Question
- [x] 3 different types of questions are supported: Freetext, Multiple choice (single answer), Multiple
choice (multi answer)
- [x] For Multiple Choice, each choice has a descriptive label that is shown to the user

## Requirements
- [x] As a user I can answers questions very swiftly so that I don’t feel like I am wasting my time
- [x] Your questionnaire is based on a JSON that the frontend uses to drive the questions
- [x] As a user I can go back to a previous question without losing the answers I have given in a current
question
- [x] Mobile First, use some SVG, use JS ES 6-7 features, good conventions for CSS

## Task
- [ ] Write a small web application that enables a user to answer a questionnaire
- [x] Use the given questionnaire.json to derive the definition of a questionnaire
- [x] Use a modern client side MVC Framework like Ember (highly preferred), GlimmerVM (bleeding edge), or
react (although we prefer emberJ)

## Goals/Priorities
- [x] Show UX skills, use CSS and possibly animate the transition between questions (high priority)
- [ ] At least 1 component test (not auto generated) (high priority)
- [x] Clean code and MVC based application structure (high priority)
- [x] There is no need to store results in a database
- [x] Bonus: The design is responsive

## General remarks
- [x] Please provide the code through a private Github or Bitbucket repository. If you don’t have an account to a repo we can provide one. Please keep track of the time you spent on the tasks.
